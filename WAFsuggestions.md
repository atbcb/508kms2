Web	| 7. Images | "Find image file types, compute and display Text Alternative name and description. </br> Additional: display role: image or indicate if decorative programmatically, mark CSS images as decorative"	| Kathy Eng
Web |	7. Images	| Find icon fonts, display role, mark as fail	| Kathy Eng
Web |	12. Page Titles |	Display the page TITLE (usually too long to be displayed in full on the browser tab)	| Kathy Eng
Web |	9. Color (contrast) |	Identify large-scale text and images of large-scale text per WCAG SC 1.4.3 which must have at least 3:1 contrast ratio. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large enough to require a lower contrast ratio. Existing FOUNT favelet provides some level of font size identification, but does not provide font size if coded with "em". If the contrast can be calculated by the tool, even better.	| Kathy Eng
Web | 3. Focus (order) | Identify tab order of interactive interface elements; can potentially strip from WAT | Kathy Eng
Web | 15. Headings | WAF headings structure only shows HTML H levels. Add aria headings and levels | Kathy Eng
