# WCAG 2.0 Applicability to Non-Web Software
Section 508, E207.2.1 addresses applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Software:
> E207.2.1 Word Substitution when Applying WCAG to Non-Web Software. For non-Web software, wherever the term “Web page” or “page” appears in WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria and Conformance Requirements, the term “software” shall be substituted for the terms “Web page” and “page”. In addition, in Success Criterion in 1.4.2, the phrase “in software” shall be substituted for the phrase “on a Web page.”

In this Baseline document, this has been applied as follows:
1. Where the content is applicable to both web and non-web software, “web page” has been replaced with “screen/web page.”
2. Where necessitated by significant differences between web and non-web testing, separate steps or sections were added. For example, under 11. Forms, Test Procedure for 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, separate sections under the Test Procedures heading: Test Instructions (Web), Test Instructions (Windows Native), and Test Instructions (Mac).
3. Where applicable, web-only, etc. baselines are titled accordingly, e.g., “Bypass Blocks (Web only).
